Front-end Code Practical Test
=============================

This repository is to be used as a base to begin writing you submission to the front-end code practical test.

This repository contains two sub-projects:

* `mock_api`: A mock API for your webapp to consume. See the [README.md](./mock_api/README.md) in that directory for more details on getting starting and using it.
* `webapp`: An empty project to write your webapp submission.

Important
----------

You will be emailed the requirements for writing the webapp and other instructions at the start of your allocated exam time.
